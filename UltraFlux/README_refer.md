**UltraFlux is a diffusion transformer that extends Flux backbones to native 4K synthesis with consistent quality across a wide range of aspect ratios. The project unifies data, architecture, objectives, and optimization so that positional encoding, VAE compression, and loss design reinforce each other rather than compete.**

## Why UltraFlux?
- **4K positional robustness.** Resonance 2D RoPE with YaRN keeps training-window awareness while remaining band-aware and aspect-ratio aware to avoiding ghosting.
- **Detail-preserving compression.** A lightweight, non-adversarial post-training routine sharpens Flux VAE reconstructions at 4K without sacrificing throughput, resolving the usual trade-off between speed and micro-detail.
- **4K-aware objectives.** The SNR-Aware Huber Wavelet Training Objective emphasizes high-frequency fidelity in the latent space so gradients stay balanced across timesteps and frequency bands.
- **Aesthetic-aware scheduling.** Stage-wise Aesthetic Curriculum Learning (SACL) routes high-aesthetic supervision toward high-noise steps, sculpting the model prior where it matters most for vivid detail and alignment.

## MultiAspect-4K-1M Dataset
- **Scale and coverage.** 1M native and near-4K images with controlled aspect-ratio sampling to ensure both wide and portrait regimes are equally represented.
- **Content balance.** A dual-channel collection pipeline debiases landscape-heavy sources toward human-centric content.
- **Rich metadata.** Every sample includes bilingual captions, subject tags, CLIP/VLM-based quality and aesthetic scores, and classical IQA metrics, enabling targeted subset sampling for specific training stages.

## Model & Training Recipe
1. **Backbone.** Flux-style DiT trained directly on MultiAspect-4K-1M with token-efficient blocks and Resonance 2D RoPE + YaRN for AR-aware positional encoding.
2. **Objective.** SNR-Aware Huber Wavelet loss aligns gradient magnitudes with 4K statistics, reinforcing high-frequency fidelity under strong VAE compression.
3. **Curriculum.** SACL injects high-aesthetic data primarily into high-noise timesteps so the model’s prior captures human-desired structure early in the trajectory.
4. **VAE Post-training.** A simple, non-adversarial fine-tuning pass boosts 4K reconstruction quality while keeping inference cost low.

## Results
UltraFlux surpasses recent native-4K and training-free scaling baselines on standard 4K benchmarks spanning:
- Image fidelity at 4096×4096 and higher
- Aesthetic preference scores
- Text-image alignment metrics across diverse aspect ratios

## Resources
We will release the full stack upon publication:
- MultiAspect-4K-1M dataset with metadata loaders
